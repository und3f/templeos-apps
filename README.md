# TempleOS Applications

The applications were created during recreational programming sessions. The
source code is developed solely in TempleOS, so the source files are in DolDoc
format. Since GitHub has limited syntax highlights for DolDoc you may find
constructions like `$ID,2$` (which is an indentation). Also sources contain
binary data because DolDoc keeps sprites in the source files, so some files are
marked as binary by GitHub. It is recommended to read the source code with the
TempleOS editor.

## Supplemental ISO

All applications are available in [Supplemental.ISO.C](Supplemental.ISO.C).
You may use it as a CD-ROM image for TempleOS virtual machine. To mount in
TempleOS execute the next commands:

```
MountIDEAuto;
Drv('T');
Dir;
```

## Applications

### Spirit

https://github.com/und3f/templeos-apps/assets/168848/1a6b4c54-21e1-458d-95be-73e4fb7113a6

Spirit is TempleOS guest agent, a helper background task which helps to exchange
information between TempleOS and host machine.

Supported operations:
* Execute user command (spawn new TempleOS window and run provided command)
* Execute command silently and return result to host machine
* Get TempleOS clipboard
* Set TempleOS clipboard

Spirit designed to be run on a boot, to install run `Install.HC`, and add to
the end of `~/HomeSys.HC`
```
#include "~/Spirit/Load"
StartUpSpirit;
```

#### Spirit Host Client (API)

Communication with Spirit guest agent is made using host agent which is
available in [./SpiritApi/C](./SpiritApi/C).
Execute `make` to build it on Linux system.
For verbose output build with `make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG`.

To make serial console available for the Spirit host agent you may share it
using tcp server. For the QEMU KVM add `-serial` options:
```
-serial tcp:localhost:4321,server=on,wait=off
```

And then execute command using host agent
```
./build/spirit-agent -c tcp:127.0.0.1:4321 exec '"Hello World!\n";'
```

See `./build/spirit-agent -h` for detailed usage.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe game with sprites, dithering, and AI. Future plans:
- Control player (player vs ai, ai vs ai, ai vs player, etc...)
- Support dynamic board size

You may launch Tic-Tac-Toe game by including the `Run.HC`:
```
#include "TicTacToe/Run";
```

### Visuals

The folder contains visual code scraps.

#### Abstract #2

#### TempleOS Cloud Theme

It is based on Terry's TempleOS Theme, some code scarps were taken from
AfterEgypt.

### HexView

HexView'er is a viewer for binary files. Display HEX presentation of content
side-by-side with printable characters.

Run with:
```
#include "HexView/Run";
```

Programmatic usage:
```
#include "HexView/Load"
HexView("C:/Once.HC.Z", 8);
```

## Repository build process

I use a macro (I've put it on personal menu for quick access), which removes
cursor marks and prepares a supplemental ISO file:
```
$MA,"Make supplemental ISO",LM="CursorRem(\"::/Home/Dev/*\"); RedSeaISO(\"::/Supplemental\", \"::/Home/Dev/\");\n"$
```

Then I mount TempleOS hard drive using [modified
fusefat](https://github.com/alanswx/fusefat/) that supports the `offset` option
(see second reference on how to find the offset) and rsync files into the repo
directory.
